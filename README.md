# My first ploomber pipeline

Using a ploomber pipeline to wrap the different steps of the BRD classifier work into a more reproducible format.

In this format, the package must be installed for anything to work
```
python -m pip install -e . -r requirements.txt
```

If I already have the correct requirements, then
```
python -m pip install -e .
```
